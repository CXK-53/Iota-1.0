# Web Iota
Iota is a web scrapy which can find all of the images and links/suburls on a webpage. To reach this goal, I used some python libraries such as [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium), [Request](https://github.com/request/request), and [Beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/bs4/)

# Usage
`python [options] [target url]`

 Options:

```
-img : Get all of the images
-link: Get all of the links
-help: Help
```
